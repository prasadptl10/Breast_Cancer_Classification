# Machine Learning Classification for Cancer Diagnosis using Neural Networks

Developed a machine learning model using the Keras framework and neural networks to classify breast cancer as malignant or benign. The project aimed to improve cancer diagnosis accuracy and assist medical professionals in making informed decisions.
Key Accomplishments:
• Collected and preprocessed a dataset containing various features related to breast cancer diagnosis.
• Utilized Keras, a powerful deep learning library, to design and train a neural network model.
• Implemented a classification algorithm that learned patterns from the dataset to predict the malignancy of breast tumors.
• Conducted extensive model evaluation, including accuracy, precision, and optimizer to assess the model's performance.
• Achieved a high accuracy rate of 93% on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of the model in classifying malignant and benign tumors.
• Employed techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to ensure robustness and optimal model performance.
• Documented the project in a clear and structured manner, including code, visualizations, and results interpretation.
• Effectively communicated the project outcomes and findings to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
